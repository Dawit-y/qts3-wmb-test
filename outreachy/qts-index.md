## Main Features

### 1. New Batch Button

The homepage prominently features a button labeled "New batch" that allows the user to create a new batch. This option is essential for starting a new set of statements within QuickStatements.

### 2. Batch Details Form

Below the main button is a form titled "Batch Details," which allows users to search for a specific batch by ID. Users can input the batch ID in the text field and submit it to retrieve the details of the batch. The input field is marked as required, ensuring that the user must provide an ID before submitting the form.

### 3. User's Batches Form

Another form is provided for searching through the batches created by a particular user. Users can input a username to find the batches associated with that user. Similar to the batch details form, the input field here is also required to ensure valid input before submission.
